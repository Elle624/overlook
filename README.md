## Project Overview

For this project I created a hotel booking application.

My app's functionality included being able to be used by two types of users, manager and customer:

As a manager, user can:
* review today's hotel's statistic
* search any customer by name, and review their booking history and total revenue
* make a new booking for any customer
* delete any unexpired booking for any customer

As a customer, user can:
* review their own booking history and total revenue
* make a new booking for themselves

Log in:
```
username: manager
password: overlook2020
```
```
username: customer50 (where 50 is the ID of the user, could be any interger between 1 - 50)
password: overlook2020
```

## Goals

My goals were to write clean and neat JS code follow SRP, more chai spy tests with TDD, getting more use of fetch, post, and first time using delete.

I also want to continue using project board and issues to plan and proficient work flow.

If I have more time, I would like to work on CSS to get more comfortable with it.

## Technologies And Tools

* JavaScript (ES6)
* Webpack
* HTML
* SCSS
* Github project board


## Challenges

My first challenge was wire-framing and design the style. I did different versions and was still adjusting as I executing the ideas. Along working deeper in my project, the challenge become applying methods and update DOM together.
Adding Chai spy tests also was less comfortable due to it is a fairly new subject.

## Wins

I'm proud that I finished functionalities in a short time period, worked on my less strong CSS skills, and made my app responsive!
